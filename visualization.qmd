## The Visualization

<!-- INSERT YOUR VISUALIZATION HERE -->
<!-- This could be an image, or actual code that generates the visualization -->

<!-- If it's an image: -->
<!-- ![Visualization Title](images/my-visualization.png) -->

<!-- OR if you want to include R/Python code to generate it: -->

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Example R code for visualization
# Replace this with your actual code

# library(ggplot2)
# library(dplyr)
# 
# your_data %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#D4A59A") +
#   theme_minimal() +
#   labs(title = "Your Visualization Title",
#        subtitle = "Your subtitle",
#        x = "X-axis label",
#        y = "Y-axis label")
```

<!-- OR for Python: -->

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# import pandas as pd
# 
# # Your visualization code here
```
